              Ventilated fabric refers to a type of material used in the construction of bulk bags that allows air to pass through the fabric. These ventilated bags are designed for products that require aeration or ventilation during storage and transportation. The ventilation helps to prevent the build-up of moisture, condensation, and odour, making them suitable
               for items such as agricultural produce, firewood, or other products that benefit from air circulation.

              The size of the bulk bag needed for logs can vary depending on the desired quantity and dimensions of the logs. A standard size for log storage and transportation is a bulk bag with dimensions of approximately 100 cm in width, 100 cm in length, and 100 cm in height. However,
               it’s advisable to consult with a supplier or expert to determine the most suitable size for your specific requirements.

              A standard bulk bag, designed to hold approximately 1,000 kg of material, can typically accommodate around 40 to 50 individual 25 kg bags. However, it’s essential to consider the specific dimensions and weight capacity of the bulk bag you are using, as well as 
              the size and density of the 25 kg bags, as these factors can vary and affect the exact quantity that can fit in a bulk load.

              FIBC stands for Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container. It is a term used to refer to large, flexible bags or containers commonly known as bulk bags or jumbo bags. 
              FIBCs are designed to handle and transport bulk materials in a safe and efficient manner.

              rPP stands for recycled polypropylene. The percentages mentioned (30% or 40% rPP) refer to the proportion of recycled polypropylene used in manufacturing a bulk bag. Recycled polypropylene is obtained from reprocessed or regrind polypropylene material, which helps to reduce waste and promote sustainability. 
              Including a certain percentage of rPP in the bag’s construction can provide environmental benefits using recycled materials.

              An FIBC, also known as a bulk bag, is a large, flexible container made from woven polypropylene fabric. These bags are designed for the storage, transportation, and handling of bulk materials such as powders, granules, and aggregates. They typically feature lifting loops for easy handling
               and are available in various sizes and configurations to suit different applications and weight capacities.
